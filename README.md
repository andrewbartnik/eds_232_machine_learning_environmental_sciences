# Machine Learning in Environmental Science
This repository contains my assignments for EDS 232 - Machine Learning for Environmental Science as part of the Masters of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program at UCSB.

In this course we used tidymodels to explore a variety of machine learning algorithms and techniques. We learned about penalized regressions, clustering, KNN, random forests, decision trees, gradient boosting, support vector machines, hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, model evaluation, and more.
